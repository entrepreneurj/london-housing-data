London House Prices
===================


Inspired by Paul Downey [[http://blog.whatfettle.com/2014/10/13/one-csv-thirty-stories/]] I have decided to take analyse the Land Registy's Paid Price dataset for areas in (and surrounding) London.

This data contains:
	Postcode locations - Ordnance Survey data Â© Crown copyright and database right 2010.
	House price data -  Contains Land Registry information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.

Useful data:
* https://github.com/utisz/compound-cities/tree/master/greater-london

note:
* Pillow depends on " sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev"
* Cairosvg depeond on "sudo apt-get install python-cairo libffi-dev"
